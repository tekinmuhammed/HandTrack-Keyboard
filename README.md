# Virtual Keyboard Using Hand Gesture

This project implements a virtual keyboard in Python where users can type using hand gestures detected by a camera. The project uses the Mediapipe library for hand tracking and OpenCV for image processing.

- Detects hand gestures using the camera.
- Enables typing by hovering over a virtual keyboard.
- Simulates keypresses using the `pyautogui` library.
- Virtual keys include standard characters, delete, capslock, and enter.

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Mediapipe
- PyAutoGUI
